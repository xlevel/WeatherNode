# WeatherHub Sensors

## DHT-22
This sensor supports the DHT-22/AM2302 combined humidity and temperature sensor.

### Config
The sensor needs to define a 'pin' value to define the data pin for the sensor. This
pin number is the GPIO number, rather than the board number.

## Necessary Files

You will need to install the BCM 2835 library - instructions can be found here: http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/
