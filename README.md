# WeatherHub 
This is a multi part weather station application aimed at the Raspberry Pi. It consits of a node application that reads data from a number of configured sensors and a hub which recieves the data from one or more local or remote nodes, stores the data and allows the user to view it via a web dashboard.

## Structure
### Weather Hub - Currently Not Being Developed


### Weather Node
This is the main data gathering application. Currently it has been developed to push the data to the Adafruit IO data platform.

### Sensors
Currently there are two supported sensors:
* DHT22 - This driver is for the DHT22 family of temperature and humidity sensors. The following devices have been tested: DHT11, DHT22, AM2302
* BMP085 - This driver is for the BMP085 family of temperature and pressure sensors. The following devices have been tested: BMP085, BMP180

## Installation

### Getting the application
